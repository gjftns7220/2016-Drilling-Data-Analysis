# 2018-Drilling-Data-Analysis

In collaboration with a team of three, I undertook an in-depth drilling data analysis targeting the Wainwright region on behalf of our client, Enerplus.

• Executed meticulous searches, sorting procedures, and analyses pertinent to the project's specifications.

• Drafted an exhaustive technical report, capturing elements such as rate of penetration (ROP), days in comparison to depths, liner designs, multi-leg lateral configurations, and casing dimensions, to name a few.

• Articulated our conclusions and insights to the client for benchmarking objectives and also presented to our educators for evaluative considerations.
